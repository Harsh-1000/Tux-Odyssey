relative paths - are paths that specify a directory/file relative to the current directory
absolute paths - are paths that start from the root directory (they start with a /)

/  - root
~  - home (logged in user home directory)
.  - represent the current working directory
.. - represent the parent directory

1.date	   - print or set the system date and time 

2.ncal	   - displays a calendar

3.man	   - an interface to the system refrence manuals

4.clear    - to clear the terminal screen

5.type	   - display information about command type

6.echo     - display a line of text

7.sort     - sort lines of text files

8.which    - to find the exact location of an executable

	     example - which ls

9.help	   - to find documentation for those commands who do not have man page for them because they are directly built in to the shell

12.cd      - it is used to change the current working directory, "moving" into another directory.
